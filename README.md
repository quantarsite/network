## 🌐 About Quantar

Quantar is building the world's first quantum-resistant Layer-1 blockchain to protect the future of cryptocurrency from quantum computer attacks.

By 2030, quantum computers will be powerful enough to break the cryptography securing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every major blockchain today. **$2.5 trillion in cryptocurrency** will be at risk.

**We're building the safe haven.**

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔐 **Post-Quantum Cryptography** - CRYSTALS-Dilithium Level 5 signatures (NIST-approved)
- ⚡ **100,000+ TPS** - 128-shard architecture for massive horizontal scaling
- 🔒 **Native Privacy** - zk-STARK layer with quantum-resistant zero-knowledge proofs
- 🏗️ **Built in Rust** - Memory-safe, high-performance systems programming

---

## 📖 The Problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Cryptocurrency at Risk** | $2.5 Trillion |
| **Threat Timeline** | 2028-2030 |
| **IBM Quantum Qubits (Today)** | 433 qubits |
| **Major Chains Vulnerable** | 100% |

Current blockchains use ECDSA/EdDSA cryptography, which will be broken by Shor's algorithm running on sufficiently powerful quantum computers.

## 🛡️ The Solution

Quantar is built quantum-resistant from day one:

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium Level 5** for digital signatures
- **256-bit quantum security** level
- **NIST-approved** standard (2024)
- Resistant to both classical and quantum attacks

### High Performance
- **128-shard architecture** for horizontal scaling
- **Proof-of-Quantum-Stake (PoQS)** consensus mechanism
- **BFT finality** in ~5 seconds
- **100,000+ transactions per second** target throughput

### Privacy Layer
- **zk-STARK** zero-knowledge proofs
- Quantum-resistant confidential transactions
- No trusted setup required
- Native privacy without compromising performance
